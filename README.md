This is the repository of R codes (R version 4.2.3) and data used for the paper "More twins in low-income countries as maternal age at birth increases" by D. Susie Lee and Kieron Barclay. 

Each R script is named in the order of its usage in the process of analyses. For example, a script starts with "0" if it runs codes that prepare data before conducting analyses. The original DHS data are not uploaded here, and "dhs_past10yrs.rds" is the file that contains the analytical sample obtained from the original data, after processing variables and selecting only necessary variables. 

In addition to "dhs_past10yrs.rds", we have uploaded the following World Population Prospects data from (https://population.un.org/wpp/)
-WPP2022_FERT_F04_BIRTHS_BY_5-YEAR_AGE_GROUPS_OF_MOTHER.xlsx

All original data are aviailable from the sources below. If you wish to directly work on the data we already processed and compiled (combining data from different sources), please use the main analytic data "dhs.RDS" which is uploaded here.

Sources of data: DHS (https://dhsprogram.com/), GDP per capita (https://data.worldbank.org/), World Population Prospects data (https://population.un.org/wpp/)
