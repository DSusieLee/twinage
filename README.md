# twinage
 
This is the repository of R codes (R version 4.2.3) used for the paper "More twins in low-income countries as maternal age at birth increases" by D. Susie Lee and Kieron Barclay. 

Each R script is named in the order of its usage in the process of analyses. For example, scripts starting with "0" indicate that they run codes that prepare data before conducting analyses. 

All original data are aviailable from the sources below. If you wish to directly work on the data we already processed and compiled (combining data from different sources), please use the main analytic data "dhs.RDS" which is uploaded here.

Sources of data: DHS (https://dhsprogram.com/), GDP per capita (https://data.worldbank.org/), World Population Prospects data (https://population.un.org/wpp/)
