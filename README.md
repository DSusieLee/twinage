This is the repository of R codes (R version 4.2.3) and data used for the paper "More twins in low-income countries as maternal age at birth increases" by D. Susie Lee and Kieron Barclay. 

Each R script is named in the order of its usage in the process of analyses. For example, a script starts with "0" if it runs codes that prepare data before conducting analyses. The sources data mentioned in the script "0_1", and the resulting data file "dhs_past10yrs.rds" are available from D. Susie Lee upon request. These data could not be uploaded due to large size. The original sources of the data are: DHS (https://dhsprogram.com/), WFS (https://wfs.dhsprogram.com/)

We have also downloaded following data from the World Population Prospects website (https://population.un.org/wpp/) between 2023-2024, for projections:
